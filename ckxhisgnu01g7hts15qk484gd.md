## Awesome CSS Tips NoBody tells you!

In my day-to-day life, I hear a lot of people say that CSS is very difficult and they hate CSS. But no CSS is great and very easy to learn. Here are 8 tips to help you improve your CSS code

### 1.  inset property

Inset property in CSS is the shorthand for the four properties top, right, bottom, and left.


```
/* normal way ðŸ’©*/
.tip-1{
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
}
/* using inset property ðŸ”¥*/
.tip-1{
    position: absolute;
    inset: 0;
}
``` 
You can also use multiple values in inset property like this ðŸ‘‡

```
.tip-1{
/* When using 4 values it should be in this order */   
inset : 10px 20px 50px 30px; /* topðŸ‘† rightðŸ‘‰ bottomðŸ‘‡  leftðŸ‘ˆ */
/* If you are using 3 values it looks like this */
inset: 5px 15px 10px; /* topðŸ‘†  leftðŸ‘ˆ/rightðŸ‘‰ bottomðŸ‘‡ */
/* If there are 2 values, they are as follows */
inset: 4px 8px; /* topðŸ‘†/bottomðŸ‘‡ leftðŸ‘ˆ/rightðŸ‘‰ */
}
``` 
If you want to know more about CSS inset property you can refer to this  [Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inset).
And  [here](https://codepen.io/seyedi/pen/PoZQQVv) is a great pen about how the inset property works.

### 2. Clamp Function

Clamp function is another shorthand in CSS. You can use this instead of the min value, max value, and regular value. Here is the syntax of it.


```
.tip-2{
    width: clamp(100px, 40vw, 650px);
/*Here the regular value of width is 40vw but it does not go under 100px
 or over the 650px*/
}

It's just like this
.tip-2{
    width: 40vw;
    min-width: 100px;
    max-width: 650px;
}
``` 
The clamp function can be essential for you in responsive web design.

.tip-3{

.tip-7{
    /* your code */
    transition: all .5 linear;
}
.tip-7:hover{
    /* your code */ 
}
``` 
After it looks like this.
